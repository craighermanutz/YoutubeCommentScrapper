# YoutubeCommentScraper
A simple web scraping tool. The user can input their desired Youtube search and the scraper will execute the search. Currently the program is set to select the top search result. Then storing the top comments in a text file. Additionally it will store the first "wave" of comments to load. However this could me modified with an additional method to load more comments, if desired. It should be noted that the "action" class is needed in each method to efficiently navigate the Youtube page, as many of the elements load asynchronously.
